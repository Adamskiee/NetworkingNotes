**HSRP for IPv6** is an extension of the **Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)** that supports IPv6 networks. It provides **default gateway redundancy** and ensures high availability in an IPv6 environment, similar to how HSRP works for IPv4.

### **Key Features of HSRP for IPv6**

1. **IPv6 Support:** Uses IPv6 addressing instead of IPv4.
2. **Virtual IPv6 Address:** Hosts use a **virtual IPv6 link-local address** as their default gateway.
3. **Active & Standby Routers:** Just like in IPv4, one router acts as **Active**, and another as **Standby**.
4. **Multicast Communication:** Uses **FF02::66** as the multicast address for HSRP messages.
5. **Preemption:** Can be enabled to allow a higher-priority router to take over automatically.
6. **ICMPv6 Support:** Works with **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** instead of ARP.

### **Basic HSRP for IPv6 Configuration**
``` cisco
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1::1/64
 standby version 2
 standby 1 ipv6 autoconfig
 standby 1 priority 110
 standby 1 preempt
 standby 1 timers 1 3
 standby 1 track GigabitEthernet0/1

```
### **Explanation:**
- `standby version 2` → Enables HSRPv2 (required for IPv6 support).
- `standby 1 ipv6 autoconfig` → Assigns a virtual IPv6 address dynamically.
- `standby 1 priority 110` → Sets priority (higher means preferred as Active).
- `standby 1 preempt` → Allows preemption (higher-priority router takes over when available).
- `standby 1 timers 1 3` → Adjusts hello and hold timers (1s hello, 3s hold).
- `standby 1 track GigabitEthernet0/1` → Tracks interface status to adjust priority dynamically.
